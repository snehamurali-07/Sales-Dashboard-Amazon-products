# Interactive Sales Dashboard for Amazon Products (Power BI)

## Overview

This project is inspired by a YouTube tutorial on creating an interactive sales analysis dashboard for Amazon product data using Power BI. It provides a visual and interactive way to understand key sales metrics, identify trends, and gain actionable insights.

This dashboard focuses on the key performance indicators (KPIs) discussed in the tutorial, such as:

* **Total Sales:** The overall revenue generated from Amazon product sales.
* **Total Profit:** The total profit earned from Amazon product sales.
* **Quantity Sold:** The total number of Amazon products sold.

The dashboard also incorporates interactive filters, allowing users to segment and analyze data based on various dimensions. As mentioned in the tutorial's 'Data Analysis Roadmap' \[[04:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhrnZGoSK70&t=274)\], this dashboard aims to provide a clear path for understanding your sales performance.

If you have access to the data, images, problem statements, domain documents, and terminology documents used in a similar project \[[05:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhrnZGoSK70&t=345)\], you can adapt this dashboard to your specific needs.

## Installation

To use this Power BI dashboard:

1.  **Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed.** You can download it for free from the official Microsoft website.
2.  **(Option 1: Using the provided `.pbix` file)** If a `.pbix` file is included in this repository, simply open it with Power BI Desktop.
3.  **(Option 2: Connecting to your own data)**
    * Open Power BI Desktop.
    * Click on "Get Data" and select the appropriate data source where your Amazon sales data is stored (e.g., CSV, Excel, database).
    * Follow the prompts to connect to and load your data.
    * You may need to transform your data using Power Query as demonstrated in the tutorial to match the required structure for the visualizations.

## Usage

Once the dashboard is open in Power BI, you can interact with it in the following ways:

* **View Key Metrics:** The top section of the dashboard typically displays the main KPIs (Total Sales, Total Profit, Quantity Sold) for a quick overview of performance.
* **Apply Filters:** Use the slicers (interactive filters) on the side or top of the dashboard to narrow down the data based on different categories (e.g., product category, date range, region). Click on the filter options to see how the KPIs and visualizations change.
* **Explore Visualizations:** Hover over charts and graphs to see detailed data points. Drill down into specific data by right-clicking on elements in the visuals (if enabled).
* **Analyze Trends:** Observe the trends in sales, profit, and quantity sold over time using the line charts or other time-series visualizations.

## Data Sources

* This project may include sample data in [specify format, e.g., `Amazon_Combined_Data.csv`]. This data is for demonstration purposes only.
* To use this dashboard with your own Amazon sales data, you will need to connect it to your specific data source. Ensure your data includes relevant fields such as sales amount, profit, quantity, product information, and date.
