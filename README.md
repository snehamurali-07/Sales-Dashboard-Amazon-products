The dashboard focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs), such as:

* **Total Sales:** The overall revenue generated from Amazon product sales.
* **Total Profit:** The total profit earned from Amazon product sales.
* **Quantity Sold:** The total number of Amazon products sold.

The dashboard also incorporates interactive filters, allowing users to segment and analyze data based on various dimensions. This dashboard provides a clear path for understanding your sales performance.
